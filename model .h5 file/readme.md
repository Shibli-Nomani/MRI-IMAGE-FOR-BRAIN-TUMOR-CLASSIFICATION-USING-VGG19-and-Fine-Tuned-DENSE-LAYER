# ðŸ˜‚ SUMMARY 


The model is based on the **VGG19 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet**, with additional dense layers fine-tuned for a specific task. With a remarkable **training accuracy of 99.905%** and a negligible training loss of **0.004%**, the model exhibits a high capacity to learn intricate patterns within the training data. During **validation**, the model achieves an accuracy of **99.314%** and low loss of **0.035**.

Upon evaluating the model's performance on **test images**, it achieves an **accuracy of 99.6947%**, showcasing its reliability and consistency across new, **unseen data**. The addition of dense layers, batch normalization, and dropout mechanisms further enhances the model's capability to generalize and avoid overfitting.

ðŸŽ‰ Overall, the model demonstrates performance across training, validation, and test datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and minimal loss. However, future improvements could involve exploring different architectures or hyperparameter tuning to potentially extract more intricate features or improve computational efficiency, aiming for even greater performance.
