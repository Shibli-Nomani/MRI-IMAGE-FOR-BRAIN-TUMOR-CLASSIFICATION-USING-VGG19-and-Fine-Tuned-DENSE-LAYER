What is an MRI Image?
MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) produces detailed images of the brain's internal structures using magnetic fields and radio waves.

**Importance of Brain Tumor Classification**
Analyzing MRI images helps categorize different brain tumors, aiding in:

1. Early detection and diagnosis.

2. Tailoring effective treatment plans.

3. Monitoring tumor progression.
